## Readme
1) For the sake of this assignment, I assumed whole integer numbers
2) Hilt/Dagger was used for dependency injection
3) I assumed a user would be adding transactions based on the current date, however, as discuss in our

implemented without the calendar, as I went according to the mockup provided.
4) Unit and Espresso tests were created as a means of testing the code
