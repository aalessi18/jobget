## Readme
1) For the sake of this assignment, I assumed whole integer numbers
2) Hilt/Dagger was used for dependency injection
3) I assumed a user would be adding transactions based on the current date, however, as discussed in our
email chain, v2 would include a calendar popup window and a new UI element to select a date in the 
DialogFragment class. Version 1 was implemented without the calendar, as I went according to the mockup provided.
4) Unit and Espresso tests were created as a means of testing
5) For data storage, I am using SharedPreferences which is being handled through the UserDataHelper class
6) Deletion of each element is handled with swiping left or right on the individual list items
